# Overview

This is a collection of example bots for demonstrating how to use the different
tools (python bindings) available in the [RLUtilities](https://github.com/samuelpmish/RLUtilities) library

## Test them out

To use these, you need a copy of 64-bit python 3.6

```
pip install RLUtilities
```

Then, start up Rocket League, and get in free play. Pick a directory, for example ```0_Ball_Prediction``` and double-click run.bat

Many of these demos require an xbox controller (or DS4Windows) to run, since they are interactive.
